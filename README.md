# DirtyKnoxss - Automated XSS Scanner Using Knoxss API
Automation for knoxss
DirtyKnoxss is a Bash script that automates Knoxss API calls to detect XSS vulnerabilities across multiple URLs efficiently.

## Features
âœ… Parallel Execution - Scan multiple URLs simultaneously for faster results

âœ… Error Handling - Displays errors and saves unfinished URLs if interrupted

âœ… XSS Filtering - Only stores URLs where XSS is detected

âœ… API Usage Tracking - Shows remaining API calls and reset time

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
```
sudo apt install jq parallel curl -y  # For Debian/Ubuntu
```
## Clone the Repository

cd dirtyknoxss
chmod +x dirtyknoxss.sh
```
## Usage
### Run the Script
```
./dirtyknoxss.sh urls.txt
```
